- Custom backend - Too much development overhead

#### Clerk
**Decision**: ✅ Selected
**Rationale**:
- Excellent user experience
- Social authentication support
- Organization features for family accounts
- Strong security and compliance
- Easy integration with Convex

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Auth0 - More complex setup
- Firebase Auth - Less user-friendly
- Custom auth - Security risks and development time

### External APIs

#### Claude API (Anthropic)
**Decision**: ✅ Selected
**Rationale**:
- High-quality AI recipe generation
- Cost-effective (~$0.03 per request)
- Good understanding of context
- Reliable and well-documented

**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenAI GPT-4 - Higher cost
- Google Bard - Less reliable
- Custom AI model - Too complex

#### Nutrition APIs
**Decision**: ✅ Selected (Edamam + Spoonacular)
**Rationale**:
- Comprehensive nutrition data
- Recipe database
- Ingredient substitution data
- Reasonable pricing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- USDA Food Database - Limited features
- Custom nutrition database - Too much work
- Single API provider - Risk of dependency

#### Photo Recognition APIs
**Decision**: ✅ Selected (Google Vision API)
**Rationale**:
- High accuracy for food recognition
- Good pricing model
- Reliable service
- Easy integration

**Alternatives Considered**:
- AWS Rekognition - Similar features
- Azure Computer Vision - Less food-specific
- Custom ML model - Too complex

### Deployment & Hosting

#### Vercel
**Decision**: ✅ Selected
**Rationale**:
- Optimized for Next.js
- Automatic deployments
- Global CDN
- Free tier available
- Easy scaling

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Netlify - Less Next.js optimization
- AWS - More complex setup
- Self-hosted - Too much maintenance

## Architecture Decisions

### Database Schema
- **Real-time updates**: Convex handles this automatically
- **User data isolation**: Row-level security with Clerk user IDs
- **Scalability**: Convex scales automatically
- **Type safety**: Full TypeScript integration

### API Design
- **RESTful principles**: Clear, predictable endpoints
- **Real-time subscriptions**: For inventory updates
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Rate limiting**: Built into Convex

### Security
- **Authentication**: Clerk handles user management
- **Authorization**: Convex row-level security
- **Data encryption**: At rest and in transit
- **API security**: Rate limiting and validation

## Cost Analysis

### Monthly Estimates
- **Claude API**: $200-500 (depends on usage)
- **Nutrition APIs**: $100-300
- **Photo Recognition**: $50-150
- **Vercel + Convex**: $50-100
- **Total**: ~$400-1050/month

### Cost Optimization
- **Caching**: Reduce API calls
- **Batch processing**: Group similar requests
- **Usage monitoring**: Track and optimize costs
- **Free tiers**: Maximize free tier usage

## Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Stack
- Next.js + Convex + Clerk
- Basic inventory management
- Manual ingredient entry

### Phase 2: AI Integration
- Claude API for recipe generation
- Basic nutrition APIs
- Recipe-inventory matching

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Photo recognition
- Advanced nutrition tracking
- Family profiles

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Performance optimization
- Cost optimization
- Advanced features

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API dependencies**: Multiple providers for redundancy
- **Cost overruns**: Usage monitoring and alerts
- **Performance issues**: Caching and optimization
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular security audits

### Business Risks
- **Market changes**: Flexible architecture
- **Competition**: Focus on unique features
- **User adoption**: Strong user experience
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture

## Success Criteria
- All technologies integrate seamlessly
- Performance meets requirements

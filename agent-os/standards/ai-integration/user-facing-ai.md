## User-facing AI features

- **Clear AI Indicators**: Clearly indicate when users are interacting with AI; set appropriate expectations about capabilities and limitations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle AI service failures gracefully; provide fallback functionality when AI is unavailable
- **User Control**: Give users control over AI features; allow them to edit, regenerate, or opt-out of AI suggestions
- **Transparency**: Be transparent about what data is sent to AI services; respect user privacy and data preferences
- **Cost Management**: Implement usage limits or quotas to prevent runaway costs from AI API calls
- **Streaming Responses**: Stream AI responses to users for better perceived performance and immediate feedback
- **Feedback Loops**: Collect user feedback (thumbs up/down) on AI outputs to improve quality over time
- **Prompt Engineering**: Invest in prompt engineering; version and test prompts systematically for better results
- **Context Management**: Provide relevant context to AI (user data, conversation history) while respecting token limits
- **Safety Guardrails**: Implement content moderation and safety checks on AI inputs and outputs
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limit AI features per user to prevent abuse and manage costs
- **Caching**: Cache AI responses for identical inputs to reduce costs and improve response time
- **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly error messages when AI fails; explain issues and suggest solutions

## Background AI processing

- **Async Processing**: Process AI operations asynchronously using job queues to avoid blocking user requests
- **Job Queues**: Use reliable job queue system (BullMQ, Inngest) with retry logic for AI processing jobs
- **Progress Tracking**: Provide progress updates for long-running AI jobs; show estimated completion time when possible
- **Webhook Notifications**: Notify users via webhooks or email when background AI processing completes
- **Batch Processing**: Batch similar AI requests together to optimize API usage and reduce costs
- **Priority Queues**: Implement priority queues for user-facing vs background AI tasks
- **Timeout Handling**: Set appropriate timeouts for AI jobs; fail gracefully and notify users of failures
- **Result Storage**: Store AI processing results persistently; make them available for future access without reprocessing
- **Retry Strategy**: Implement exponential backoff retry for transient AI API failures; use dead letter queue for permanent failures
- **Cost Tracking**: Track AI usage per job, user, and tenant for cost attribution and billing
- **Monitoring**: Monitor job queue health, processing times, and failure rates for AI operations
- **Cancellation**: Allow users to cancel long-running AI jobs; properly clean up resources on cancellation
- **Idempotency**: Make AI jobs idempotent to safely handle retries without duplicate processing

## Prompt management and versioning

- **Centralized Prompts**: Store prompts in centralized location (code or database) rather than scattered throughout codebase
- **Version Control**: Version prompts alongside code; track changes and enable rollback to previous versions
- **Template System**: Use template system for dynamic prompts with variable interpolation
- **Prompt Testing**: Test prompts systematically with diverse inputs; measure quality and consistency of outputs
- **A/B Testing**: A/B test different prompts to optimize for quality, cost, and user satisfaction
- **System Prompts**: Define clear system prompts that establish AI behavior, tone, and constraints
- **Context Injection**: Structure user context clearly in prompts; format for optimal AI comprehension
- **Token Management**: Monitor and optimize prompt token usage; trim unnecessary context to reduce costs
- **Prompt Libraries**: Build library of reusable prompt components and patterns for consistency
- **Documentation**: Document prompt design decisions, expected outputs, and edge case handling
- **Safety Instructions**: Include safety and ethical guidelines in system prompts to prevent harmful outputs
- **Output Formatting**: Specify desired output format clearly in prompts (JSON, markdown, etc.) for reliable parsing
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Include few-shot examples in prompts for better output quality and consistency

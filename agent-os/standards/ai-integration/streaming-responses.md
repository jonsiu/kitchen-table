## Streaming AI responses

- **Server-Sent Events**: Use SSE or WebSockets for streaming AI responses to client in real-time
- **Incremental Rendering**: Render AI output incrementally as it streams for immediate user feedback
- **Cancellation Support**: Allow users to cancel streaming requests; properly clean up server-side resources
- **Error Handling**: Handle stream interruptions gracefully; show partial results and explain errors
- **Reconnection Logic**: Implement reconnection logic for dropped connections during streaming
- **Buffering Strategy**: Buffer chunks appropriately to balance responsiveness with rendering efficiency
- **Progress Indicators**: Show typing indicators or progress while AI is generating response
- **Rate Limiting**: Rate limit streaming endpoints to prevent resource exhaustion from long-running streams
- **Timeout Handling**: Set reasonable timeouts for streaming responses; fail gracefully on timeout
- **Partial Results**: Save partial results on client-side during streaming to prevent loss on connection failure
- **Token Counting**: Track tokens consumed during streaming for cost attribution and usage limits
- **Stream Completion**: Clearly indicate when stream is complete vs interrupted vs errored
- **Client Libraries**: Use appropriate client libraries (Vercel AI SDK, etc.) that handle streaming complexity

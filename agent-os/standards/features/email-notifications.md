## Email notification system

- **Transactional Email Service**: Use dedicated transactional email service (SendGrid, Postmark, Resend) for reliability and deliverability
- **Email Templates**: Create reusable email templates with consistent branding; use template engines or provider's templates
- **Plain Text Alternatives**: Always include plain text version alongside HTML emails for accessibility and spam prevention
- **Unsubscribe Links**: Include unsubscribe links in marketing emails (legal requirement); honor unsubscribe preferences
- **Email Categories**: Categorize emails (transactional, marketing, notifications) and respect user preferences for each category
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent email bombing; batch notifications when appropriate
- **Queue Processing**: Process email sending asynchronously through background jobs to avoid blocking request threads
- **Retry Logic**: Implement exponential backoff retry for failed email sends with dead letter queue for persistent failures
- **Testing**: Use email capture services (Mailtrap, MailHog) in development; test email rendering across clients
- **Personalization**: Personalize emails with user data; ensure proper escaping to prevent injection vulnerabilities
- **Tracking**: Implement open and click tracking for marketing emails; respect user privacy preferences
- **SPF/DKIM/DMARC**: Configure proper email authentication records to improve deliverability and prevent spoofing
- **Bounce Handling**: Handle bounces (hard and soft) appropriately; disable emails to addresses with hard bounces
